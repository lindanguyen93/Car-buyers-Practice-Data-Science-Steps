This project is to practice data science process:
- I will examine some data files and carry out the first several steps of the data science process, including the cleaning and exploring of data.
- I will develop and implement appropriate steps, in IPython (Jupyter Notebook), to load some data files into memory, clean, process, and analyse them.
- I will  perform EDA and regression model has been built using sample code from my lectures.
